# Level_8_Lab

This repository contains Python functions and notebooks which step you through pre-processing motion capture data (once processed through Nexus), to inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, and muscle analysis results.

The assumption has been made that an opensim model has been previously created and scaled, and placed in the appropriate folder.

This code is written in Python 3 for OpenSim 4.0. This means that you will have to build the OpenSim API from source. Instructions are detailed within the OpenSim Tools folder.
